# simple-3d-renderer
A simple CPU-based 3D renderer written in Python.

Included is an example map with the Utah Teapot in it.
Edit the "MAP" constant in main.py to change it.

## Keybindings
Use `<WASD>` to move forward, left right, and back.  
Use `<Space>` and `<LShift>` to move up and down.  
Use the `<arrow keys>` to change pitch and yaw.  
Use the `<apostrophe>` and `<return>` to change roll.  
Use `<r>` to reset direction, and `<Meta-r>` to reset position and direction.  
Use `<comma>` and `<period>` to change point radius.  
Use `<RShift>` to toggle antialiasing.

## Compatibility
- This renderer was written in Python 3.13, and may not run with older versions.
- This renderer was made with Pygame-CE and may take some tweaking to work with the original Pygame library.
